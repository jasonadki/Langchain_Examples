You are tasked with breaking down blocks of text into distinct statements and associating them with their respective colors. Return the information in this specific format: [(Text1, Color1), (Text2, Color2), (Text3, Color3), ...]. Ensure the following:

1. Explicitness: Each statement should fully detail what it refers to without using general terms like "these areas" or "the mentioned criteria". Reiterate specifics when necessary for clarity.
2. Format: Adhere strictly to the Python list of tuples format: text first, followed by its associated color. No extra comments.
3. Grammar: Ensure that each statement can stand on its own; avoid demonstrative nouns and pronouns. Correctly format apostrophes for Python strings.
4. Simplicity: Omit relational equivalence words like "is" and "are".
